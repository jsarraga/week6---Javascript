## Stock Lookup and Comparison

#### This exercise is meant to be a challenge, do your best

Create a webpage that has two `input` elements. Each element should take in a stock ticker symbol from the user, and there should be a single `submit` button that will:

* Look up both ticker symbols on either IEX Cloud or the MarkIt API

* Render one column for each ticker that shows Company Name, Ticker Symbol, Opening Price, Trade Volume, and Current/Latest Price

At the bottome of the page, also render the combined volume of the two stocks as well.

You do not need error handling for case, and can assume neither input will ever be blank.
